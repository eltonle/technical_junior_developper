# Part 2: Written Questions

## Question 2.1: Explain your decisions

- Structuring code in this way allows for better organization and separation of concerns in your application. It also makes the code more modular, which facilitates maintenance and testing. You can reuse the Book model in different parts of your application, guaranteeing consistency of data and book-related operations.
- store sensitive information, such as API keys and passwords, in environment variables perform Dependency Management

## Question 2.2: Code Review




app.post('/user', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = req.body;
    
    // Validate user input
    if (!user.age || isNaN(user.age)) {
      res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid user data' });
    }

    if (user.age < 21) {
       res.status(400).json({ error: 'User is too young' });
    }

    await db.addUser(user);
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'User added successfully' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'something is wrong' });
  }
});



# Part 3: Time Management Task


 #### To prioritize and tackle these tasks in the space of a week, I could follow the following plan:

 ###### Day 1: Fix the critical bug in the connection module


- Examine error reports and logs to understand the nature of the bug.
- Develop the patch and test it works correctly.

the reason: Fixing the critical bug is the top priority because it affects system stability. This must be resolved first to avoid any negative impact on users.

 ###### Day 2: Complete the bug fix and deploy the patch


- Finalize the patch, and ensure internal validation.


 ###### Day 3: Develop new functionality in high demand from customers

- Gather detailed requirements for the new functionality from stakeholders.
-Design the feature architecture.

Reason: Development of the new feature is important to meet customer needs, but must wait until the critical bug has been fixed.

  ###### Day 4: Continue new feature development


- Begin development of the new feature, following design principles and best practices.
- Run tests during development to detect errors as early as possible.



 ###### Day 5: Document the API developed in Task 1


-Automatically generate or manually write clear, concise API documentation.- Share the documentation with the team and stakeholders for comments and revisions.Why: API documentation is essential to ensure that developers and users understand how to use the API correctly.

 ###### Day 6: Optimizing database queries in an existing module

- Examine existing database queries and identify opportunities for optimization.
-Optimize queries, using indexes if necessary, and carry out performance tests.

 ###### Day 7: Finalize new functionality and deploy database optimizations
 
 - Complete development of the new functionality and carry out comprehensive tests.
 - Deploy the new functionality and database optimizations on the production server.
  
  Reason: Optimizing database queries can improve overall system performance, but this can be done after the critical bug has been resolved and the new feature developed.
